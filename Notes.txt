NODE JS -> for Backend 

Node JS is basically a runtime environment for JavaScript 
Traditionally JS can only be executed on browser but now that v8 js engine is taken out using c++ and embedded 
in such a way we can run js in local machines as well that embedded thing is called Node JS 

<------  Architecture of Node js ------>

Event Queue -> A queue that recieves request from client continously and process them one by one in queue order.

Event Loop -> A loop continously looking upon event queue and process each request from the queue. 

For each request there are two tyoes of operation -> 
i.  Blocking Code       (Synchronous Code)  -> Complex operations 
ii. Non Blocking Code   (Asynchronous Code) -> Simple operations

If the request is a Non Bloacking request Node.js executes it immeditaley completes it. 

If the request is a Blocking code the event loop sends the request to pool thread and checks if there is any
available thread (no. of threads depends on the no. of Core IN CPU) to execute the code . If there is no Thread 
in Thread pool the code is blocked and event loop is also haulted untill a thread is available in thread pool 
for exectuing the code.   

<------ ------>

Whenever buidling any backend project first initialise the 'init' file which will create a package.json file 
which will act as a meta data and contains info about included libararies and other project details.

<------ ------>

Modules -> When writing code in Backend it is good to divide the functionalities in modules and file
just so that not one file handles all the work load. 

once written a code in a file and module we need to export those functionalities 

file 1 ->

function add(a , b){
    return a+b ;
}

module.exports = {                           // create a export object and exports these functionalities
    add : addFunction 
}

file 2 -> 
const add = require('./file1name.js')        //import file  './' means in same directory 


const http = require('http')                 //to import inbuild libararies and functionalities



<------ CREATING A SERVER USING HTTP ------>

const http = require('http') ;
const PORT = 3000 ;
const server = http.createServer((req , res)=>{              
    res.end('Hello from server Side') ;
})

server.listen(3000 , ()=>{
    console.log('Server started ....') 
}) ;

// a callback function is used to handle request and  response .
// the server has to be on port number listening to requests continously .


<------ FILE SYSYTEM LIBRARY ------>

It is used for file handling 

const fs = require('fs') ;

fs.writeFileSync( FILEPATH  , ITEM TO BE WRITTEN ) ; //Synchronous call i.e. Blocking code

fs.writeFile( FILEPATH  , ITEM TO BE WRITTEN , (err , succ) =>{  // Asynchronous call i.e. Non Blocking Code
    if(succ){
        console.log('Task completed') ;
    }
    else if(err){
        console.log('Error occured') ;
    }
}) 


<------ HTTP METHODS ------>

GET    -> To get (retrieve data from server) 
POST   -> To initialise a new instance of Data on server or DataBase (when first time put in DB) 
PUT    -> To update an existing Data refrence 
PATCH  -> To partialy update a record 
DELETE -> To remove a record from server 

by default the browser do a get request everytime .


<------ URL PARSING ------>

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox/FMfcgzQXJQNsdXKJHdlFfzkMMPcQGDnD

after ? there are parameter for url like queries.
her -> ?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox

Now we can process a url with URL external library but to check and code for every PATH and different 
HTTP METHODS for each path is quite hard and time taking to overcome that we have EXPRESS.

<------ EXPRESS ------>

with express library we effectively handle all the paths in url and corresponding http requests efficiently 
first install express in packag.json 


const express = require('express') ; // import it
 
const app = express() ;              // creater an app of express which will handle all the complications.
const port = 12934 ; 

app.get('/' , (req , res)=>{              // '/' defines the home page and a call back functions to handle response and request
    res.end('Hello From ServerSide') ;
});
                                           
app.get('/profile' , (req, res)=>{         // '/profile' path 
    res.end(`hello my friend ${req.query.name}`) ;
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log('Server started perfectly') ;
})


--> to handle multiple request on a specific path we can use 

app.route('/user').get((req , res)=>{      // with route function we can handle multiple request done on a same route.
    res.end('a get request') ;
    return ;
}).post((req , res)=>{
    res.end('a post request') ;
}).patch((req , res)=>{
    res.end('a patch request') ;
    return ;
}).put((req , res)=>{
    res.end('a put request') ;
    return  ;
}).delete((req , res)=>{
    res.end('a delete request') ;
    return ;
}) ;


<------ MIDDLEWARE IN EXPRESS ------>

1.Middlerware are special functions which will act as a mediators when a request is raised and are the first ones
  to process req and res.
2.Middlerwares can update and modify the req object programmitically .
3.Middlerwares can also stop the req and res cycle to directly send response to the client from the middleware.
4.Since there can be multiple middleware function we can call the next middlerware function as well. The next middlerware
  function will be called identified and called by the expressed itself.\



app.use(express.urlencoded({extended : false})) ; // Whenever we want to access req data from the client we use this middlerware
                                                
the urlencoded method add all the key value pairs from the form data to the req object .

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()       // calling the next middlerware
})

app.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {             // a middlerware on a specific path.
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})
